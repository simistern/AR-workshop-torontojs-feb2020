### TorontoJS: React Native AR Workshop

 In advance of the Augmented Reality Workshop, please make sure you have the boilerplate prepared! Please complete the following steps ahead of time. This will give us more time to focus on the fun parts of the workshop!

 Make sure your computer is set up to develop react native applications. This means that with a generic `react-native init <project>` you are able to get something up and running in react native. 

 We will be using phones instead of simulators: Please make sure your phone supports AR Applications!

## Steps to prepare for Workshop 

Step 1: Download Viromedia app to your phone, we need this for its TestBed feature which will help us iterate faster!  
Step 2: globally install ngrok with npm or yarn  
Step 3: globally install react-viro-cli with npm or yarn
Step 4: In your  react-viro init **[MyJSWorkshop]**
Step 5: Run the app:  npm start
step 6: Ngrok should give you a forwarding address at https://[myurl].ngrok.io
step 7: Find the **testbed** on the ViroMedia app and enter that address in. If all goes well, your app should render!
